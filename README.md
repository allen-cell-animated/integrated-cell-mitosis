#### About:
This is a predictive cell model in both cell shape and over time. 

This is "integrated cell model" which uses cell shape and nuclear shape to predict the localization pattern of the structures we have collected data on at the Allen Institute, walking through simulated mitosis. We collected images of various stages of mitosis, and then used that as training data to create this simulation. 

DNA is light blue, Lamin B is dark blue, Sec61-beta is orange, Alpha-tubulin is yellow, and the membrane is (transparent) purple.
